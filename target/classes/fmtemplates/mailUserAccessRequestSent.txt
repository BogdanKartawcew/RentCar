<h3>Dear ${user}, </h3>
<div>
    <p>Thank you for testing my app.<br>
    <p>Regarding the designed process - to get the app secured - the access request<br>
        must be approved by administrator before you get the whole access.<br>
    - sorry for that, but in real environment it should be in this way :) </p>
    <p>By the way, your credentials are the next and still be the same even after the complete access granted:</p>

    Login: ${login}<br>
    Password: ${password}<br>

    <p>About the end of authorization process you also will be informed via this email address.
</div>
<p>
Best regards,<br>
