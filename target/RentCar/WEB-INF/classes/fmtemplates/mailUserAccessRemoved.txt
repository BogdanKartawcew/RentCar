<h3>Dear ${user}, </h3>
<div>
    <p>It's annoyingly for us to announce you, that your access has been removed.<br>
        From now your login <b>${login}</b> is inactive and you can't use it.
    <p>We really hope that your choise will change in the future and you will join us again.<br>
    In any time you can do it through this <a href="http://java-experience.eu/accessrequest">link</a>
</div>
<p>
    Wish you all the best,<br>
